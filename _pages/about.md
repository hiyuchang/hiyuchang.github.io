I am Yuchang Sun. I am currently working in DAIL, Alibaba as Senior Algorithm Engineer.

I received the Ph.D. degree from The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) in 2024, supervised by [Prof. Jun Zhang](https://eejzhang.people.ust.hk/), and the B.Eng. degree from Beijing Institute of Technology (BIT) in 2020. 
During my Ph.D., I was fortunate to visit EURECOM, advised by [Prof. Marios Kountouris](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=QG9iXtUAAAAJ&hl=en) and to intern at Alibaba, mentored by [Yuexiang Xie](https://xieyxclack.github.io/) and led by [Dr. Yaliang Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=CCPBcdYAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN).

If you are interested in my research, do not hesitate to contact me (hiyuchang AT outlook.com) in English or Mandarin.
